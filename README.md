ADNS9800_LCD
============

Updates to rpriyadarshi's code to make the code work with the latest version of the Arduino firmware (as of August 2022) as well as implementing the ability to capture frames.

Currently the code does not make use of the LCD features rpriyadarshi added but were left in place to be optionally used in the future. The code is also still a WIP so contains some commented functionality/old code.

To make the circuit easier to recreate, the ADNS9800 header file now include a modified with which pin shorthands corresponds to the datasheet names.
